Back in 2004, a new feature was added to iTunes version 4.9. that would change the idea of radio forever. Apple introduced the humble Podcast in the iTunes release notes as "... frequently updated radio-style shows downloadable over the Internet". 

[The simple technological nature](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting.htm) of a Podcast—its no more than a glorified RSS feed—and a library of high profile content, set the Podcast up to be an immediate hit in the realm of digital media.

According to [a study conducted by Pew in 2016](http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/podcasting-fact-sheet/) there's somewhere around 30,000 podcasts in existence, and 21% of the US population say that they listen to podcasts at least once per month. I must listen to about 14 hours of podcast content every week, and when us humans spend enough time doing anything, we inevitably start thinking of ways it could be improved.

Coming up are some ideas that I've had about how to make podcasts better from both the listener's and the producer's perspective...

## Speech to Text & Quote Highlighting
If a Podcast app had this feature, I'd probably find a use for it with every Podcast episode I listen to. No more rewinding, opening a notes app, and then repeatedly pausing while noting down—line by line—something you hear that's worth remembering.

I imagine the process going something like this:
1. Hear something that's worth quoting.
2. Goto app and tap 'Share quote', revealing a rolling transcript.
3. Select the desired portion of the transcript, and then choose the appropriate action (save, share, share with audio).

A nice cherry on top would be that last option: share with audio. A link to the Podcast could be shared with a timestamp, sending a user straight to the quote (or, exactly how YouTube URLs work).

## Embedded Content
If you listened to podcasts in the early days, you'll probably remember something that podcasts don't seem to have any more: sequential artwork. 

For anyone not familiar with the idea, sequential artwork is where the podcast artwork changes over time as the podcast is played. Similar to a slideshow. I've seen this used for ads or to add context to different parts of the episode.

Embedded media is the same idea as sequential artwork except it wouldn't be restricted to pictures. I can imagine this being useful for debates, academic Podcasts, and even presentations, where citations or visual aids are crucial to the thing making sense.

A good use case for embedded interactions could be in storytelling—especially history—when narratives aren't joined together perfectly. If the story hits a fork in the road, the listener could simply choose which direction she wants to go next, always having the option to step back and follow a new thread.

## Direct Listener Feedback
Podcasts joined us just before the internet social revolution kicked off, when sites like YouTube and Facebook and their "like economy" blew up.

I wonder, if Apple announced the Podcast now in 2016, might they be sucked into the social rabbit hole? Would social features even add any value to Podcasts?

When I got into using Periscope last year, I was fascinated by one of the services features that I'd never really seen before. With Periscope anybody watching your stream can tap a heart shaped button on their screen to send you immediate 'love', transmitting to you their approval of whatever you just did. Kind of like positive reinforcement.

Imagine if the same kind of idea could be utilised for Podcasters. A listener could send their approval, or gratitude, or love, or whatever, at the very moment its pertinent. Never again would a listener have to stop procrastinating for long enough to compose nice emails for all of their favourite Podcast hosts. They could just tap a button right there on their phone screen and make someone's day.

My favourite use case so far for this immediate feedback system would be to use it to send micro payments—probably with a crypto currency like Bitcoin because banks are funny about moving small sums of money. Imagine if you could tip your favourite Podcaster every time they blew your mind.

## Keep on Thinking ✨
So those are some ideas I've had for improving how we do Podcasts. I honestly don't see any reason for Podcast app developers not to try more their own ideas out like the ones above (if you make a Podcast app, I'd love to hear from you). 

There's no harm in building additional features if they don't affect the podcast protocol its self. Think progressive enhancement with Podcasts.
